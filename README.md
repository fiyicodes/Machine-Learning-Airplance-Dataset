## Airline Survey Analysis

### Research Objectives
1. **Objective 1**: Predict the level of satisfaction a passenger will have based on their ratings for services like Seat comfort, Food and drink, In-flight Wifi, Baggage handling, etc.
2. **Objective 2**: Identify which service areas (e.g., Food and drink, In-flight entertainment, Cleanliness, etc.) correlate most with lower satisfaction scores, and provide actionable insights for improvement.
3. **Objective 3**: Determine whether factors like age, gender, or customer type (First-time vs Returning customers) result in different satisfaction levels. Cluster the data based on the data.
4. **Objective 4**: Determine the satisfaction outcome based on the image of a person taking the survey.

### Project Milestones
- **R1**: Project Direction and Questions (Week 1 & 2)
  - Define clear objectives and hypotheses (e.g., key factors influencing satisfaction).
  - Complete initial exploratory data analysis and problem identification.
  
- **R2**: Data Analysis and Preprocessing (Week 3 & 4)
  - Perform data cleaning, handle missing values and transform features.
  - Visualize relationships and identify important patterns.
  
- **R3**: Clustering (Week 4 & 5)
  - Use clustering algorithms to segment passengers based on similar characteristics and satisfaction levels.
  - Evaluate clustering results using silhouette scores.
  
- **R4**: Baseline Training and Evaluation (Week 6 & 7)
  - Train three machine learning models: Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes for classification.
  - Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  
- **R5**: Neural Networks (Week 8 & 9)
  - Implement Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), CNN, SGD for satisfaction prediction.

## Requirement Descriptions (R4â€“R5)

**Decision Trees**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f942477c-f6cd-4aaf-b3e7-b11299b2c92a)
The Decision Tree is with best parameters from Grid Search results. We observed that Tree 1 demonstrates a slightly better balance of precision, recall, and F1 score, although it has slightly lower test accuracy. Tree 2 performs equally well in terms of test accuracy compared to Tree 3, but it offers slightly better precision and recall. Tree 3, on the other hand, lags slightly in both precision and F1 score, making it a less optimal choice overall.

**Logistic Regression**

**Bayes Net Algorithm**

Best Performing Algorithm: Categorical Naive Bayes
**Tabular Data**

Analysis Using Keras Perceptron Function with 10-Fold Cross-Validation and Evaluation Metrics
When validation is performed across the entire dataset, it gives an accuracy of 94%; as against 91% by cross-validation on the selected feature set.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e56bccf-0a3a-4083-b37b-1c80c19956a9)
We Experimented with different parameters that affect the learning process, such as learning rate, the number and size of layers, number of iterations, batch size, epochs.

Architecture 6 provides the best balance of high accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and precision.

All classifiers seem to generalize reasonably well to new data. The models are not overfitting, as they perform similarly on unseen test data.

**Image Data**
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13708666-4aab-4685-800a-19dd2ab45734)
**The CNN** outperformed all other models with the highest accuracy of **36.78%,** demonstrating its ability to effectively extract spatial features from the image data. Despite its superior performance, there is still room for improvement, particularly in reducing false positive rates for dominant classes like happy. Further optimization, such as deeper architectures or transfer learning, could enhance results.
